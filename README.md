# Algorithm-Visualization - AlgViz

Make SVGs of data structures from your code.

## Development

This package is supported by [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for development.

#### Setup

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

#### Linting
We rely on pipenv's built in Flake 8 code style checker.
```
pipenv check --style ./path/to/files/
```

## Use as a package
We do not have a release right now, so to experiment you can add it via a git clone
